<h1 align="center">Welcome to the Digital Life Tracker 👋</h1>


## 🤔 Problem
We spend a lot of their time on screens and it's quite easy to lose track of the time we spend digitally. There are existing solutions to track their life but most of them are either paid, steal personal data or aren't visually appealing. That's why we decided to build this project. It will collect data on Mobile as well as Desktop devices and show them in a Progressive Web App(PWA). 

## ✨ Features
- PWA Dashboard to display all the collected data from different devices.
- Background application for data collection from Desktop using NodeJS and from Mobiles using Flutter/Kotlin(To be decided).
- Backend built with Django
- Once a simple product is ready, we'll work on features to summarize our weeks and discover patterns in our behaviour. 
- Tech Stack : React, NodeJS, Django, Flutter/Kotlin

## 📄 Creating a PR

If you want to optimize this project, add features or remove bugs from this project, you are highly encouraged to do so by creating a PR. Your PR would be reviewed by the maintainer and then it depends on maintainer to merge that PR or not.

If you don't know how to create a PR, don't worry. Here is a step-by-step procedure on how to proceed to create a PR.


**#**  Take a look at the existing or create your own issues. A first good issue can be updating README file. Since Open Lake maintainers are generous enough, it is optional to create a issue or wait for a issue to be assigned to you, you can directly create a PR without creating an issue.

**1.**  Fork repository.

**2.**  Open Git Bash.

**3.**  Clone your forked copy of the repositary.

```
git clone <link of your forked repo>
```

**4.** Navigate to the project directory .

```
cd <repo name>
```

**5.** Add a reference(remote) to the original repository.

```
git remote add upstream <original repo link>
```

**6.** Check the remotes for this repository.

```
git remote -v
```

**7.** Always take a pull from the upstream repository to your master branch to keep it at par with the main project(updated repository).

```
git pull upstream master
```

**8.** Create a new branch.

```
git checkout -b <your branch name>
```

**9.** Perform your desired changes to the code base.

**10.** Track your changes .

```
git add . 
```

**11.** Commit your changes .

```
git commit -m "your message"
```

**12.** Push the committed changes in your feature branch to your remote repo.

```
git push -u origin <your branch name>
```

**13.** To create a pull request, click on `compare and pull requests`. Please ensure you compare your feature branch to the desired branch of the repo you are suppose to make a PR to.

**14.** Add appropriate title and description to your pull request explaining your changes. You can see the official PR Format Guidelines [here](https://github.com/OpenLake/Leaderboard-Pro/wiki/PR-Format-Guidelines).

**15.** Click on `Create Pull Request`.

**16.** Congratulations! you have made your PR.
