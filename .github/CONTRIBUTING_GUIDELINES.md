## Setup üõ†Ô∏è

### Step 1

- Fork this repository by clicking `fork button`

- Clone the repository in your local machine by typing

  ```git
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Cross-Platform-Activity-Tracker.git
  ```

  in your terminal(for _mac/linux_) or Git Bash (for _windows_)

- Now create a new branch using

  ```git
  git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>
  ```

### Step 2

- Install `nodejs` and `npm` on your local machine. For [windows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-of-node-js-on-windows/), [linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04) and [mac](https://nodesource.com/blog/installing-nodejs-tutorial-mac-os-x/)

- Install `Visual Studio` on your local machine, only for [windows](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools). (Please note that this is different from Visual Studio Code)
- Mac user install `Xcode Command Line Tools` by running

  ```git
  xcode-select ‚Äìinstall
  ```

- Install `pnpm` by opening your terminal with administrative (sudo) privileges and type

  ```git
  npm i -g pnpm
  ```

- Open your terminal in your current working directory (i.e, `Activity-Tracker`) and run the following command to install all dependencies for the project

  ```pnpm
  pnpm i
  ```

### Step 3

- Navigate to `Activity-Tracker` directory and type

  ```pnpm
  pnpm tracker
  ```

- If you get an error, type these commands

  ```pnpm
  pnpm dlx rimraf node_modules
  ```

  ```pnpm
  pnpm install
  ```

  Now try to run the command again.

  ```pnpm
  pnpm tracker
  ```

- To start the application run

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

- Open a browser and enter

  ```link
  http://localhost:3001/
  ```

  at this address the web application will be running

### Step 4 (Optional)

If you want to use MongoDB, you can either

- Download [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) locally.
  Linux user can use these steps for [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/) installation.

  OR

- Install wsl on your machine, only for [windows] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and also download ubuntu from microsoft store.
  wsl and ubuntu installation is not required for windows 10 pro.

- Install docker on your machine. We are using docker container to run MongoDB so that it remains isolated from rest of the system and is easy to setup. For [windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/), [linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/).

- Install `docker-compose` by following the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
  `docker-compose` is already installed when using docker desktop for Windows/macOS.

- Navigate to `Activity-Tracker` directory and with administrative privileges run

  ```docker
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
